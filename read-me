To setup :

Run 'npm install'
Run 'npm start'

Used material ui, redux toolkit, momentJS.
Added data table component with the pagination.
Results show only for the upcomming months. So drop down shows only the upcoming months.
Token will clear on the logout button.

If time permits,

Will do more styles to the application to feel better.
I may add the images depending on the screen resolution. (mobile, tablet, desktop)
Add some loading gifs
May clean and optimize the code and add few comments
